## Problem 1

Create a city\_state variable and a binary variable indicating whether
the homicide is solved.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = as.factor(victim_race),
    victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition  == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition  == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition  == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL",
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")
    ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Create a dataframe for Baltimore, MD

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

head(baltimore_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##   city_state    resolved victim_age victim_race victim_sex
    ##   <chr>            <dbl>      <dbl> <fct>       <fct>     
    ## 1 Baltimore, MD        0         17 Black       Male      
    ## 2 Baltimore, MD        0         26 Black       Male      
    ## 3 Baltimore, MD        0         21 Black       Male      
    ## 4 Baltimore, MD        1         61 White       Male      
    ## 5 Baltimore, MD        1         46 Black       Male      
    ## 6 Baltimore, MD        1         27 Black       Male

Fit the logistic regression for Baltimore, MD

``` r
glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>%
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Run glm for each of the cities in dataset

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())), 
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

As shown in the plot, the estimated ORs of solving homicides comparing
Black victims to White victims for most cities were relatively close and
were smaller than 1, except that Fresno, CA and Stockton, CA had
slightly higher ORs (between 1 and 1.5), and Albuquerque, NM had the
highest OR (between 1.5 and 2). These three cities also had the largest
range of confidence interval, indicating greater uncertainty.

We can conclude that the odds of solving homicides with Black victims
was smaller than the odds of solving homicides with White victims in
most cities in the U.S..
